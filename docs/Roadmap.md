🗺 Trophaeum Roadmap
Phase 1: Genesis (MVP Launch)

Deploy TROPHY token (Avalanche Fuji testnet).

Launch AR/VR MVP: open plain with Sun 🌞, Moon 🌙, Earth 🌍 nodes.

Scanning rituals trigger treasury flows + live counters.

Custodial wallet auto-created on login.

Initial indigenous partners onboarded:

Tolu Tharling Monastery (Moon)

Native American Tribe (Sun)

African cooperative/village (Earth)

🎯 Goal: Prove the core ritual cycle + legitimacy through indigenous onboarding.

Phase 2: Cultural Expansion

Add first Macro Node twins (monastery courtyard, tribal council, village market).

Onboard 2+ additional indigenous communities as macro nodes.

Launch basic marketplace for micro-node goods (physical + digital).

Introduce Moon rituals: full-moon AR/VR events, donor constellations, soulbound badges.

Governance layer: macro node assemblies can propose + vote on local issues.

🎯 Goal: Expand legitimacy and utility through culture, commerce, and governance.

Phase 3: Rituals & Treasury Growth

Launch TROPHY/AVAX and TROPHY/USDC liquidity pools.

Moon Treasury stabilization:

LP rewards recycling → buybacks.

Offerings → soulbound Moon NFTs with perks.

Add Holiday nodes (e.g., Christmas = global donation pool).

Tree Node cycle: environmental rewards tied to regrowth seasons.

Onboard NGOs + public-good organizations (education, climate, fair trade).

🎯 Goal: Strengthen tokenomics + expand ritual culture globally.

Phase 4: Metaverse Evolution

Expand VR world beyond open plain → cultural districts.

Proposal Halls in macro nodes (governance embodied in-world).

Shops integrated with TROPHY/USDC swaps (physical fulfillment + NFT claims).

Multi-user rituals: chanting, drumming, constellation events.

AR/VR sync: rituals experienced simultaneously across both layers.

Brand onboarding: ethical B Corps, fair trade partners, aligned organizations.

🎯 Goal: A cultural + economic metaverse powered by ritual and community commerce.

Phase 5: Global Cultural Web

Scale to hundreds of macro nodes and thousands of micro nodes.

Interconnected treasuries visualized as streams of light linking nodes.

NGO + city participation (urban renewal, grassroots projects).

Partnerships with ethical brands (Patagonia, Indego Africa, Global Mamas, etc.).

VR “pilgrimage tours” across nodes, AR nodes accessible anywhere.

Trophaeum becomes a living global web of compassion, wisdom, and manifestation, rivaling corporate/government systems in legitimacy.

🎯 Goal: A decentralized cultural web where economy, spirit, and governance interlink as one.
