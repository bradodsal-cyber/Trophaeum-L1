# 🌞🌙🌍 Trophaeum

**Trophaeum** is a new Layer 1 blockchain protocol rooted in **indigenous legitimacy, cultural renewal, and regenerative economics**.  
It is not just a chain — it is a living network where **Compassion (Sun)**, **Wisdom (Moon)**, and **Manifestation (Earth)** form the triad that guides value circulation.

At its heart, Trophaeum uses AR/VR rituals to link nodes and flow tokens:
- **Sun Node** radiates compassion (token minting).
- **Moon Node** reflects wisdom (treasury stabilization).
- **Earth Node** grounds manifestation (distributes to communities).
Together, they form a **self-sustaining cycle of value**.

## ✨ Why Trophaeum?
- **Indigenous legitimacy**: Partnerships with Tolu Tharling Monastery (Dzogchen lineage), Native American tribes, and African cooperatives anchor Trophaeum in living traditions.  
- **Public good first**: Funds flow transparently into cultural, environmental, and community treasuries.  
- **Cultural web**: Macro nodes (communities, institutions) and micro nodes (goods, services, culture) weave together into a global cultural economy.  
- **Metaverse with purpose**: Not a land grab. The virtual world grows organically from Sun, Moon, Earth → cultural districts → a global cultural web.
